This is a R Markdown project that showcases data analysis and visualization using the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Index. The WPS Index measures women's well-being and empowerment in countries around the world, and the scores are based on a range of indicators, including legal frameworks, security, and access to healthcare and education. The data used in the analysis is the WPS Index 2021. The analysis involves two parts. The motivation behind this research topic is to contribute to the ongoing efforts to promote gender equality and women's rights worldwide by providing an evidence-based approach to monitoring the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security agenda.

The output consists of two visualizations:

1. The distribution of WPS Index scores by quintile

2. The relationship between employment and WPS Index score, displayed through a scatterplot with a loess curve and boxplots by quintile, and a faceted scatterplot by quintile.

The distribution of WPS Index Scores by Quintile shows that higher scores indicate better performance on indicators such as legal frameworks, security, and access to healthcare and education. The second analysis investigates the relationship between employment and the WPS Index Score for each Quintile separately. This is done by creating a faceted plot with a regression line for each Quintile.

The code includes data wrangling and data visualization, using packages such as tidyverse, patchwork, knitr, kableExtra, and xaringanExtra.

Overall, the code provides an exploratory analysis of the WPS Index data, aiming to identify potential patterns or relationships between various indicators and women's well-being and empowerment.
